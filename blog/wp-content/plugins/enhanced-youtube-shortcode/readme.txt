A simple YouTube shortcode with basic options & general improvement over the default coming with Wordpress.


== Description ==

The "**Enhanced YouTube Shortcode**" plugin provides a quick & easy way to use a custom *YouTube&copy;* player in your posts and/or pages without having to get your hands dirty in the source codes! The main advantage over the way *Wordpress* is working this out is the possibility of changing the display of all players in one single spot instead of having to do it manually at every places it has been set. But most importantly: *it's fun and good for you*!

The code that is generated always allows scripting access and forces the use of the *ActionScript 3* engine (*to be sure everybody has the same settings*). There are **now 9 parameters** available through a configuration page (*reach it from the Settings Menu*). It has been initially created (*& tested*) on a *Wordpress 3.2.1* live installation according to the specifications of the official *YouTube API*: see the [YouTube Embedded Player Parameters](http://pxsol.info/naqwb2 "YouTube Embedded Player Parameters - YouTube APIs and Tools - Google Code") page for quick references.

There are many things on the **To Do** list (*see **Other Notes***) so you can expect updates soon!


== Installation ==

1.  Extract the **/enhanced-youtube-shortcode/** folder from the downloaded file.

2.  Upload this extracted folder & its content in your *Wordpress* plugin directory.

3.  Go to "**Plugins=>Enhanced YouTube Shortcode**" & activate the plugin.

4.  Go to "**Settings=>Enhanced YouTube**" to tweak player options.

5.  Now use  **[youtube_video id="abxjy-emFvs"]** kind of shortcode.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Trying to read and/or edit your codes is far from a "user friendly" experience. =

Pretty normal: I don't work with this stuff ;-) For the sake of file size I've removed most PHP comments & HTML bits indentation, not to mention the minified CSS. Please go to the official [«Enhanced YouTube Shortcode» GitHub Public Repositories](http://pxsol.info/nrqCdW "Pixel-Solitaire/Enhanced-YouTube-Shortcode - GitHub") in order to obtain a clean & commented version of the source codes.

= I'm using *Internet Explorer 6* and the settings page just looks awful... =

Oh, I'm *soooo* sorry for you. *Really*. Maybe it's time for you to give up, don't you think?

= You're a french speaking bloke, *right*? So where is the translation? =

It's quite simple: I just have to learn how to do it properly... You can bet the french language will be added in the version 2.0.

= I got an indecent proposal idea & doesn't see anything related to this here... What could I do? =

Open up a window & shout it out loud. If you try hard enough maybe I'll hear it...

= I think you're a genius & I want you to be the father of my children. =

*Well*... If you're actually a sexy blond woman with lot of money and a big car I believe we can form a real complete couple: I offer quite the opposite ...
