Most Popular Tags is a plugin that displays your blog's most popular tags or categories as a sidebar widget

== Description ==

Most Popular Tags is a WordPress plugin that allows you to display your blog's most popular tags or categories as a sidebar widget. The plugin takes advantage of the new Widget API introduced in WordPress 2.8, allowing multiple instances of the same widget, each with it's own unique configuration. You can specify how many tags/categories to show, the size of the smallest and largest ones, which unit and format to use as well as advanced ordering options.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `mostpopulartags.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. The Most Popular Tags widget can now be configured and used from the Appearance -> Widgets menu

== Changelog ==

- 2.85: Added the option to display link categories in addition to regular categories and tags
- 2.8: Added the option to choose a separator (when format is "flat") and a new "random" order option. Additionally, the plugin now displays all tags/categories by default, not 10. The 2.8 version requires WordPress 2.9 or higher.
- 2.6.1: Fixed a bug that appeared in some environments
- 2.6: The different unit options were causing some confusion, so a link to the W3Schools CSS unit reference has been added to the widget configuration view
- 2.5: Added a nifty uninstaller that removes all traces of the plugin when it's deleted via the Manage Plugins menu
- 2.0.1: Readme.txt spelling corrections
- 2.0: Added the option to display categories in addition to tags
- 1.1: Added millimeters, centimeters, inches and picas to the font unit menu. Additionally, all of the settings have been updated with more descriptive text.
